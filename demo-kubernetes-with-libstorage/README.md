# DEPRECATED - DO NOT USE# Exploring Kubernetes with libStorage Persistent Volumes on AWSThe [libStorage](http://libstorage.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) integration with [Kubernetes](http://kubernetes.io/) has been submitted by the [{code} team](https://thecodeteam.com/) as a [Pull Request #28599](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/28599) for consideration by the Kubernetes project.Until this is merged into the Kubernetes tree, this procedure can be utilized to evaluate Kubernetes using libStorage enabled external volume mount support.This document aspires to be an homage to [@kelseyhightower](https://twitter.com/kelseyhightower) ‘s brilliant Kubernetes the Hard Way [project](https://github.com/kelseyhightower/kubernetes-the-hard-way). It's not a model for production deployment, but for evaluation.This tutorial goes from beginning to end to better understand all thecomponents and configuration involved. This process will build Kubernetes fromsource, manually installing the build tools and libStorage. This exercise shouldtake 45 minutes or less.Kubernetes and libStorage can run on many cloud and physical platforms withmultiple host OS options and support a growing number of storageplatforms. libStorage allows automation to deal with the combination ofenvironment options.**NOTE:** Non-AWS choices of computing and storage platforms are identical tothis tutorial. libStorage is designed to make it feasible to add, swapor migrate workloads and providers at many levels.**NOTE: This lab only uses a single node configuration. A multi-node tutorialis currently in progress of testing.**![architecture](img/k8-lib-arch.jpg "architecture")### Prerequisites- An Amazon AWS account with:    - an ssh key pair for remote login    -  An Access Key for API access        - Access Key ID        - Secret Access Key ### Step 1: Deploy an EC2 AMI (VM)1. Choose EC2 from the AWS console dashboard, an `Launch an Instance`.2. The following directions are all based on Ubuntu. Use the **Ubuntu Server16.04 LTS (HVM), SSD Volume Type**. 64-bit. The ami number varies by region. A`t2.large` instance type is recommended because the Kubernetes build can utilize over 4GB of memory. (An `m4.large` could also be utilized.)3. Configure instance details to set the Root volume to `40GB`. Other settings can be left as default.4. Select your ssh key and launch.5. Optionally: name the instance `kubernetes-libstorage` while it initializes.### Step 2: Install GoLogin to the VM using the tool of your choice. The AMI's user and password will be `ubuntu`.Execute these commands (copy and paste multiple lines at a time):```cd ~curl https://storage.googleapis.com/golang/go1.6.3.linux-amd64.tar.gz | tar xvzsudo chown -R root:root ./go/ sudo mv go /usr/localecho "export GOPATH=$HOME/work" >> .profile echo "export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin:$HOME/work/bin" >> .profilesource .profile```### Step 3: Install Docker```sudo apt-key adv --keyserver hkp://p80.pool.sks-keyservers.net:80 --recv-keys 58118E89F3A912897C070ADBF76221572C52609Decho "deb https://apt.dockerproject.org/repo ubuntu-xenial main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.listsudo apt-get updatesudo apt-get install -y docker-engine```### Step 4: Install etcd```curl -L https://github.com/coreos/etcd/releases/download/v3.0.13/etcd-v3.0.13-linux-amd64.tar.gz | tar xvzsudo chown -R root:root ./etcd-v3.0.13-linux-amd64/sudo mv etcd-v3.0.13-linux-amd64/ /usr/local/sudo ln -s /usr/local/etcd-v3.0.13-linux-amd64/etcd /usr/local/bin/etcdsudo ln -s /usr/local/etcd-v3.0.13-linux-amd64/etcdctl /usr/local/bin/etcdctl```### Step 5: Install build tools: g++, make, mercurial, unzip, ```sudo apt-get install -y g++ make mercurial  unzipgo get -u github.com/tools/godepgo get -u github.com/jteeuwen/go-bindata/go-bindata```### Step 6: Git Checkout the libStorage fork of Kubernetes from GitHub```mkdir -p $GOPATH/src/k8s.io && cd $GOPATH/src/k8s.iogit clone https://github.com/vladimirvivien/kubernetes.gitcd kubernetesgit remote add upstream https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes.gitgit checkout -b libstorage-take4 origin/libstorage-take4```### Step 7: Install REX-Ray[REX-Ray](http://rexray.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) is a vehicle for installing aprepackaged instance of a libStorage server (or lightweight client with CLI).This server centralizes and abstracts the consumption of external persistentstorage. In a large scale production cluster, REX-Ray would be run as a centralservice, within a container, using the high availability features of theorchestrator platform. Sine this tutorial uses a single node Kubernetesinstallation in this exercise, it happens to be on the single cluster node.```curl -sSL https://dl.bintray.com/emccode/rexray/install | sh -```As sudo, create the file `sudo vi /etc/rexray/config.yml` with this contentusing your favorite editor, and substituting your AWS details (two keys and region):```rexray:  loglevel: warn  modules:    default-docker:      disabled: truelibstorage:  logging:    level: debug  host: tcp://127.0.0.1:7979  embedded: true  service: ebs  server:    endpoints:      public:        address: tcp://127.0.0.1:7979    services:      ebs:        driver: ebsebs:  accessKey: <my-access-key-here>  secretKey: <my-secret-key-here>  region:    <my-aws-region>  maxRetries: 7```Start REX-Ray as a service:```sudo rexray service start```### Step 8: Build and run Kubernetes```sudo susource /home/ubuntu/.profileexport KUBERNETES_PROVIDER=localcd /home/ubuntu/work/src/k8s.io/kubernetes hack/local-up-cluster.sh ```The build will take approximately 10 minutes using the recommended `t2.large`instance type. **Warning:** build failures on a host with inadequate memory canresult in errors not obviously related to memory.### Step 9: Verify SuccessLeave the previous window since that is keeping the Kubernetes service running.Start a new terminal session by SSHing to the EC2 instance. The followingcommands will verify the newly built and deployed Kubernetes instance isworking.```export KUBERNETES_PROVIDER=localcd work/src/k8s.io/kubernetes/cluster/kubectl.sh config set-cluster local --server=http://127.0.0.1:8080 --insecure-skip-tls-verify=truecluster/kubectl.sh config set-context local --cluster=localcluster/kubectl.sh config use-context localcluster/kubectl.sh get nodescluster/kubectl.sh get podscluster/kubectl.sh get servicescluster/kubectl.sh get deployments```### Step 10: Use a Persistent Volume in a PodCreate an EBS volume using the REX-Ray CLI:```rexray volume create mysql-1 --size=1```This can be verified by examining the result shown below. The creation of thespecified volume can be confirmed using the ELASTIC BLOCK STORE Volumes section of the AWS console.```ubuntu@ip-172-31-37-235:~/work/src/k8s.io/kubernetes$ rexray volume create mysql-1 --size=1ID            Name      Status     Sizevol-72a2eec6  mysql-1  available  1```A Kubernetes pod is a group of one or more containers, the shared storage forthose containers, and options about how to run the containers. This pod is doinga strict 1:1 mapping of a single mysql container to the EBS volume thatwas created.Create `pod.yaml` with this content (`sudo vi pod.yaml`):```apiVersion: v1kind: Podmetadata:  name: mysql  labels:    name: mysqlspec:  containers:  - image: mysql:5.6    name: mysql    env:      - name: MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD        # CHANGE THIS PASSWORD!        value: yourpassword    ports:      - containerPort: 3306        name: mysql    volumeMounts:      # This name must match the volumes name below.    - name: mysql-persistent-volume      mountPath: /var/lib/mysql  volumes:  - name: mysql-persistent-volume    libStorage:      host: http://127.0.0.1:7979      # This disk must already exist      volumeName: mysql-1      service: ebs```Deploy the pod:```cluster/kubectl.sh create -f pod.yaml```View status of all pods:```cluster/kubectl.sh describe pod```Use the AWS console to verify that the volume was created and that it is shown as "in-use" indicating it is attached to a VM### Step 11: Use Persistent Volume Claims in a PodUsers of Kubernetes can request persistent storage for their pods. Administrators can utilize *claims* to allow the storage provisioning and life-cycle to be maintained independently of the applications consuming storage. A background process satisfies claims from an inventory of *persistent volumes*. Persistent volumes are intended for "network volumes" such as: -  GCE persistent disks -  AWS elastic block and file stores -  "overlay" storage providers like ScaleIO.  A Persistent Volume (PV) in Kubernetes represents a  piece of underlying storage capacity in the infrastructure.A user (or application) views and consumes a PersistentVolumeClaim, whichhides storage platform details. This allows an application'sconfiguration to be portable across platforms and providers.Create a new EBS volume with the REX-Ray CLI:```rexray volume create admin-managed-1g-01 --size=1```Create a Kubernetes persistent volume referencing it with `pv.yaml`. This volumeis mapping the pre-created volume to a Kubernetes implementation (`sudo vipv.yaml`). This is a job typically performed by Operations orStorage Administrators:```kind: PersistentVolumeapiVersion: v1metadata:  name: small-pv-pool-01spec:  capacity:    storage: 1Gi  accessModes:    - ReadWriteOnce  libStorage:    host: http://127.0.0.1:7979    service: ebs    volumeName: admin-managed-1g-01```Make the Persistent Volume available to Kubernetes applications. ```cluster/kubectl.sh create -f pv.yaml```Next, a Postgres database needs access to a volume to store persistent data. Anapplication or developer needs a Persistent Volume Claim that will requeststorage from any Persistent Volume available to Kubernetes (previousstep). Nothing is directly mapped in a Persistent Volume Claim, it's an abstracted storage functionality.Create a Kubernetes 1GB persistent volume claim for the Postgres data in`pvc.yaml` (`sudo vi pvc.yaml`):```kind: PersistentVolumeClaimapiVersion: v1metadata:  name: pg-data-claimspec:  accessModes:    - ReadWriteOnce  resources:    requests:      storage: 1Gi```Request the Persistent Volume Claim to Kubernetes.```cluster/kubectl.sh create -f pvc.yaml```Lastly, Create a pod that uses the Postgres container and the persistent volumeclaim from the previous step in `pod-pvc.yaml`. (`sudo vi pod-pvc.yaml`):```kind: PodapiVersion: v1metadata:  name: postgres  labels:    name: postgresspec:  containers:    - name: postgres      image: postgres      env:        - name: POSTGRES_PASSWORD          # CHANGE THIS PASSWORD!          value: mysecretpassword        - name: PGDATA          value: /var/lib/postgresql/data/pgdata      ports:      - containerPort: 5432        name: postgres      volumeMounts:      - mountPath: /var/lib/postgresql/data        name: pg-data  volumes:    - name: pg-data      persistentVolumeClaim:        claimName: pg-data-claim```Deploy the pod:```cluster/kubectl.sh create -f pod-pvc.yaml```View status of all pods:```cluster/kubectl.sh describe pod```### Step 12: Utilize Dynamic Provisioning by Storage ClassDynamic provisioning is a mechanism that allows storage volumes to be created on demand, rather than pre-provisioned by an administrator. This is a Beta feature of Kubernetes 1.4.The first step is creating a storage class. The name of the storage class is anarbitrary label. In this instance, it's going to be called `bronze`:Create the file `sc.yaml` (`sudo vi sc.yaml`):```kind: StorageClassapiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1beta1metadata:  name: bronze  labels:    name: bronzeprovisioner: kubernetes.io/libstorageparameters:  host: http://127.0.0.1:7979  service: ebs```Make the Storage Class available to Kubernetes applications. ```cluster/kubectl.sh create -f sc.yaml```Create a persistent volume claim that utilizes the storage class in`sc-pvc.yaml` (`sudo vi sc-pvc.yaml`):```kind: PersistentVolumeClaimapiVersion: v1metadata:  name: pvc-0002  annotations:      volume.beta.kubernetes.io/storage-class: bronzespec:  accessModes:    - ReadWriteOnce  resources:    requests:      storage: 1Gi```Request the Persistent Volume Claim to Kubernetes.```cluster/kubectl.sh create -f sc-pvc.yaml```Create a pod that uses a Webserver that dynamically deploys the volume from EBSand mounts it to the container in `pod-sc-pvc.yaml` (`sudo vi pod-sc-pvc.yaml`):```kind: PodapiVersion: v1metadata:  name: podscpvc-0001spec:  containers:    - name: webserv      image: gcr.io/google_containers/test-webserver      volumeMounts:      - mountPath: /test        name: test-data  volumes:    - name: test-data      persistentVolumeClaim:        claimName: pvc-0002```Deploy the pod:```cluster/kubectl.sh create -f pod-sc-pvc.yaml```View status of all pods:```cluster/kubectl.sh describe pod```## ContributionCreate a fork of the project into your own repository.
